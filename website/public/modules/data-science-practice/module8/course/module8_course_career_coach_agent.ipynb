        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the construction of an advanced agentic system using LangGraph, a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. The Career Coach Agent exemplifies how multiple specialized tools can be orchestrated to solve complex, multi-step career planning tasks.\n",

        "## Architecture Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent implements a graph-based workflow where:\n",
        "- **State**: Maintains conversation history and intermediate results\n",
        "- **Nodes**: Represent computational steps (LLM reasoning, tool execution)\n",
        "- **Edges**: Define transitions between nodes (conditional routing based on agent decisions)\n",
        "- **Tools**: External functions the agent can invoke (CV analysis, job search, etc.)"

        "- **context**: Additional metadata or intermediate results\n",
        "\n",

        "### Graph Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "The graph consists of:\n",
        "1. **Agent Node**: LLM that decides which tool to call or how to respond\n",
        "2. **Tool Node**: Executes the selected tool and returns results\n",
        "3. **Conditional Edges**: Route flow based on agent decisions (continue with tools or finish)\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture enables the agent to:\n",
        "- Chain multiple tool calls\n",

        "\n",
        "### Motivation for Open-Source Models\n",
        "\n",
        "While GPT-4 provides excellent tool-calling capabilities, open-source models from HuggingFace offer several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- **Cost**: Free inference (local) or low-cost API endpoints\n",
        "- **Privacy**: Run locally without sending data to third parties\n",
        "- **Customization**: Fine-tune models for domain-specific tasks\n",
        "- **Control**: No API rate limits or service dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tradeoffs:**\n",
        "- **Performance**: Generally lower tool-calling accuracy than GPT-4\n",
        "- **Resource requirements**: Require significant GPU memory for local inference\n",
        "- **Integration complexity**: May need custom parsing for tool calls\n",
        "\n",
        "### Models with Native Tool Calling Support\n",
        "\n",
        "Several HuggingFace models support structured tool calling:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** (8B parameters)\n",
        "   - Native function calling support\n",
        "   - Moderate hardware requirements (16GB+ VRAM)\n",
        "   - Good balance of performance and efficiency\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **NousResearch/Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B** (8B parameters)\n",
        "   - Specifically trained for function calling\n",
        "   - Excellent tool selection accuracy\n",
        "   - Widely used in production agentic systems\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **meetkai/functionary-small-v2.5** (7B parameters)\n",
        "   - Optimized exclusively for tool calling\n",
        "   - Lower resource requirements\n",
        "   - Fast inference speed\n",
