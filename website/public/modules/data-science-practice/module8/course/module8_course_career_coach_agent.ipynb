    "# Career Coach Agent: LangGraph Multi-Tool Agentic System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the construction of an advanced agentic system using LangGraph, a framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. The Career Coach Agent exemplifies how multiple specialized tools can be orchestrated to solve complex, multi-step career planning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent implements a graph-based workflow where:\n",
    "- **State**: Maintains conversation history and intermediate results\n",
    "- **Nodes**: Represent computational steps (LLM reasoning, tool execution)\n",
    "- **Edges**: Define transitions between nodes (conditional routing based on agent decisions)\n",
    "- **Tools**: External functions the agent can invoke (CV analysis, job search, etc.)"

    "## LangGraph Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Management\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph maintains a typed state object that persists across node executions. For conversational agents, the state typically includes:\n",
    "- **messages**: List of conversation turns (user inputs, agent responses, tool outputs)\n",
    "- **context**: Additional metadata or intermediate results\n",
    "\n",
    "State updates are functional: each node returns a dictionary of updates that are merged into the current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph consists of:\n",
    "1. **Agent Node**: LLM that decides which tool to call or how to respond\n",
    "2. **Tool Node**: Executes the selected tool and returns results\n",
    "3. **Conditional Edges**: Route flow based on agent decisions (continue with tools or finish)\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture enables the agent to:\n",
    "- Chain multiple tool calls\n",
    "- Reason about tool outputs\n",
    "- Dynamically adjust its strategy"

The decorator:\n- Extracts the function signature for the LLM\n- Provides the docstring as the tool description\n- Handles serialization of inputs and outputs\n\nThe LLM uses tool names and descriptions to decide when to invoke each tool. Well-written docstrings are critical for correct tool selection.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\nAll tools use **real LLM-based implementations** for dynamic, context-aware responses:\n- **CV Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o-mini to analyze CVs and provide detailed feedback\n- **Market Research**: Uses LLM with current knowledge to provide realistic market insights\n- **Learning Resources**: Uses LLM to recommend real courses and platforms\n- **Job Search**: Uses LLM to generate realistic job opportunities (production would use job board APIs)\n- **Cover Letter Generation**: Uses LLM to create tailored, professional cover letters\n- **Salary Negotiation**: Uses LLM to provide data-driven negotiation strategies\n\nThis approach provides:\n- Dynamic responses based on actual CV content\n- Context-aware recommendations\n- Professional-quality outputs\n- Easy extensibility to real APIs in production"

   "source": "## Extending the Agent\n\n### Adding New Tools\n\nTo extend functionality, simply:\n1. Define a new function with `@tool` decorator\n2. Add it to the `tools` list\n3. Update system prompt to describe the new tool\n\nExample new tools:\n- **LinkedIn profile optimizer**: Analyze and improve LinkedIn profiles\n- **Interview question generator**: Create practice questions for target roles\n- **Company culture researcher**: Investigate company values and work environment (use web search)\n- **Network connection finder**: Identify mutual connections at target companies (integrate with LinkedIn API)\n\n### Current Implementation vs. Production\n\n**Current State** (Educational/Demo):\n- ✅ Real LLM-based CV analysis\n- ✅ Real LLM-based cover letter generation\n- ✅ Real LLM-based market research (based on training data)\n- ✅ Real LLM-based learning resource recommendations\n- ⚠️ LLM-generated job opportunities (realistic but synthetic)\n- ⚠️ LLM-based salary research (general knowledge, not live data)\n\n**Production Enhancements**:\n1. **Job Search**: Integrate real job board APIs\n   ```python\n   # Example: Adzuna API, Indeed API, LinkedIn Jobs API\n   import requests\n   \n   def search_jobs_real(role, location, salary_min):\n       api_key = os.getenv(\"ADZUNA_API_KEY\")\n       url = f\"https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs/{location}/search\"\n       params = {\"what\": role, \"salary_min\": salary_min}\n       response = requests.get(url, params=params)\n       return parse_job_results(response.json())\n   ```\n\n2. **Market Research**: Use real-time job market data\n   - Integrate with labor statistics APIs\n   - Scrape job boards for current postings\n   - Use salary databases (Glassdoor, Payscale APIs)\n\n3. **Learning Resources**: Query course platforms\n   - Udemy API for course search\n   - Coursera API for recommendations\n   - GitHub for project examples\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Add robust error management\n   ```python\n   @tool\n   def analyze_cv(cv_text: str, target_role: str) -> str:\n       try:\n           llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0.3)\n           response = llm.invoke(analysis_prompt)\n           return response.content\n       except Exception as e:\n           return f\"Error analyzing CV: {str(e)}. Please try again.\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Caching**: Reduce API costs and improve speed\n   ```python\n   from functools import lru_cache\n   \n   @lru_cache(maxsize=100)\n   def research_market_trends(role: str, location: str) -> str:\n       # Cache results for repeated queries\n       ...\n   ```\n\n6. **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits\n   ```python\n   import time\n   from ratelimit import limits, sleep_and_retry\n   \n   @sleep_and_retry\n   @limits(calls=10, period=60)  # 10 calls per minute\n   def call_external_api():\n       ...\n   ```\n\n### Advanced Features\n\nPotential enhancements:\n- **Human-in-the-loop**: Allow user to approve/modify agent decisions before execution\n- **Memory**: Store user preferences and past interactions using LangChain memory\n- **Multi-agent**: Separate specialized agents (CV expert, job search specialist, negotiation coach)\n- **Streaming**: Stream agent thoughts and tool outputs in real-time for better UX\n- **Evaluation**: Automated testing of agent performance on career coaching tasks\n- **Web Search Integration**: Add web search tool for real-time information gathering\n\n### Cost Optimization\n\nCurrent implementation costs (approximate):\n- **Main Agent** (GPT-4o): ~$0.01-0.02 per complete career analysis\n- **Tool Calls** (GPT-4o-mini): ~$0.001-0.002 per tool\n- **Total**: ~$0.02-0.05 per user session\n\nTo reduce costs:\n1. Use GPT-4o-mini for main agent (80% cost reduction)\n2. Cache common queries (market trends, learning resources)\n3. Switch to open-source models for non-critical tools\n4. Implement request batching where possible"
