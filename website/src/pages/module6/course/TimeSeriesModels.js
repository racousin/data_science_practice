        <p>
          Time series analysis involves working with data points indexed in time
          order. It's crucial in many fields, including finance, economics, and
          weather forecasting.

        <h2>ARIMA Models</h2>
        <p>
          ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular class of
          models for time series forecasting.

        <p>
          Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an
          additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly,
          and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

          Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural
          network, can be very effective for time series prediction.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Time series models are crucial for analyzing and forecasting
          sequential data. While ARIMA models are traditional statistical
          approaches, Prophet offers a more flexible framework, and LSTMs
          represent the deep learning approach to time series. Each has its
          strengths and is suitable for different types of time series data and
          forecasting tasks.
