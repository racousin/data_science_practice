          <h2>Introduction to Neural Networks for Tabular Data</h2>
          <p>
            Neural networks are a type of machine learning model that are
            inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They can
            be used to solve complex problems that are difficult to solve with
            other types of models.
          </p>
          <h2>Designing Deep Neural Architectures (e.g., TabNet, MLPs)</h2>
          <p>
            Designing deep neural architectures for tabular data involves
            choosing the number and type of layers, the number of nodes in each
            layer, and the activation functions to use. TabNet and MLPs
            (Multilayer Perceptrons) are two common architectures for tabular
            data.

          <h2>Feature Embeddings for Categorical Data</h2>
          <p>
            Categorical data can be represented as one-hot encoded vectors, but
            this can lead to high dimensionality and sparsity. Feature
            embeddings are a technique for representing categorical data as
            dense vectors that capture the underlying patterns in the data.
