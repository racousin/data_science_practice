        (AutoML) tools designed for tabular data.

          <h2>Overview of AutoML and its Benefits</h2>
          <p>
            AutoML is a technique that automates the process of building machine
            learning models. It can be particularly useful for tabular data, as
            it can automatically handle tasks such as data preprocessing,
            feature engineering, and model selection. AutoML can save time and
            improve accuracy compared to manual machine learning pipelines.
          </p>
          <h2>Popular AutoML Frameworks (e.g., H2O, Auto-sklearn)</h2>
          <p>
            There are several popular AutoML frameworks that are designed for
            tabular data. H2O is an open-source AutoML platform that supports a
            wide range of machine learning algorithms and can be used for both
            classification and regression tasks. Auto-sklearn is another popular
            AutoML framework that is built on top of scikit-learn and can
            automatically search for the best machine learning pipeline for a
            given dataset.

          <h2>Best Practices for Using AutoML in Professional Settings</h2>
          <p>
            While AutoML can be a powerful tool, it is important to use it
            responsibly in professional settings. It is important to understand
            the limitations of AutoML and to validate its results using
            appropriate techniques. It is also important to ensure that the
            models built by AutoML are interpretable and transparent, so that
            stakeholders can understand how the models are making predictions.
