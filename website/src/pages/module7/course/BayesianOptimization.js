        technique for efficient hyperparameter tuning.

          <h2>Principles of Bayesian Optimization</h2>
          <p>
            Bayesian optimization is a probabilistic approach to hyperparameter
            tuning. It models the objective function as a Gaussian process and
            uses this model to make predictions about the performance of
            different hyperparameter configurations.
          </p>
          <h2>Implementing Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes</h2>
          <p>
            Gaussian processes are a type of probabilistic model that can be
            used to model the objective function in Bayesian optimization. They
            are particularly well-suited for handling noisy and expensive
            objective functions.

          <h2>Comparisons with Grid Search and Random Search</h2>
          <p>
            Bayesian optimization can be more efficient than grid search and
            random search for hyperparameter tuning. It can find the optimal
            hyperparameters in fewer iterations and can handle noisy and
            expensive objective functions more effectively.
