            Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) is an approach where the
            agent learns a model of the environment's dynamics and uses this
            model to make decisions or improve its policy.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Environment Model:</strong> A function that predicts the
              next state and reward given the current state and action.

          <h3>Advantages of Model-Based RL</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Sample Efficiency: Can learn from fewer interactions with the
              environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transfer Learning: The learned model can potentially be used for
              different tasks in the same environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explainability: The model provides insights into the environment's
              dynamics.

          <h3>Model Learning</h3>
          <p>The environment model can be represented as:</p>

            math={`
            \hat{s}_{t+1}, \hat{r}_{t+1} = f_\theta(s_t, a_t)

          <p>
            Where <InlineMath math="f_\theta" /> is typically a neural network
            parameterized by <InlineMath math="\theta" />.
          </p>
          <p>The model is trained to minimize the prediction error:</p>
          <BlockMath
            math={`
            \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}, r_{t+1}) \sim \mathcal{D}} [

          <h3>Planning with Learned Models</h3>
          <p>
            Once a model is learned, it can be used for planning. Common
            approaches include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Model Predictive Control (MPC):</strong> Simulate multiple
              trajectories and choose the best immediate action.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dyna:</strong> Use the model to generate additional
              training data for a model-free RL algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):</strong> Build a search
              tree of possible future states and actions.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Model Bias:</strong> Errors in the learned model can lead
              to suboptimal policies.

            <li>
              <strong>Computational Complexity:</strong> Planning with the model

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Model-Based Reinforcement Learning offers a powerful framework for
            sample-efficient learning and planning. While it comes with its own
            set of challenges, ongoing research continues to push the boundaries
            of what's possible with MBRL, making it an exciting area of study in
            the field of AI and robotics.
