      <p>
        In this section, you will understand and implement policy-based and
        actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning.

          <h2>Policy Gradient Methods</h2>
          <p>
            Here, we'll discuss what policy gradient methods are and how they
            are used in reinforcement learning.
          </p>

          <h2>Actor-Critic Architectures</h2>
          <p>
            We'll cover the concept of actor-critic methods, which combine the
            benefits of value-based and policy-based methods.

    this.actor = actor;
    this.critic = critic;

            We'll explore two advanced policy-based methods: A2C (Advantage
            Actor Critic) and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).
