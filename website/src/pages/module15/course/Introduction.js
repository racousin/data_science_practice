      <h1 className="my-4">Introduction to Reinforcement Learning</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, you will learn about the fundamentals of reinforcement
        learning and its framework.

          <h2>Overview of RL</h2>
          <p>
            Here, we'll discuss what reinforcement learning is and how it
            differs from other types of machine learning.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
          <p>
            We'll cover the key concepts in reinforcement learning, including
            agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, and policies.
          </p>
