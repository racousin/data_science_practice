      <h1 className="my-4">Overview of the Machine Learning Pipeline</h1>
      <p>
        Understanding the machine learning pipeline is crucial for effectively
        applying models to real-world problems. This pipeline encompasses
        several key stages, each critical for ensuring the accuracy and
        efficiency of the final model.

          <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
          <p>
            Data collection is the first step in the machine learning pipeline.
            It involves gathering the necessary data from various sources, which
            could include databases, online repositories, or real-time systems.
            The quality and quantity of data collected significantly impact the
            performance of the resulting model.
          </p>

          <h3 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning and Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Once data is collected, it must be cleaned and prepared. This step
            involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting
            data into a format suitable for analysis. Effective data cleaning
            can significantly improve model accuracy.
          </p>

          <h3 id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to
            select, modify, or create new features from raw data. This step is
            vital as it directly influences the model's ability to learn
            significant patterns from the data.
          </p>

          <h3 id="model-building">Model Building</h3>
          <p>
            This stage involves selecting and training machine learning models
            using the prepared data. It may include experimenting with different
            model architectures, algorithms, and parameters to find the best fit
            for the data.
          </p>

          <h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            After a model is built, it must be evaluated to assess its
            performance. This usually involves using a separate validation
            dataset to test the model, ensuring that it generalizes well to new,
            unseen data.
          </p>

          <h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            Deployment is the process of integrating a machine learning model
            into an existing production environment where it can make
            predictions on new data. This step requires careful planning to
            manage resources and ensure that the model performs as expected in
            real-time.
          </p>

          <h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring and Maintenance</h3>
          <p>
            Once deployed, it's essential to continuously monitor the model to
            catch any performance degradation or failures. Maintenance may
            involve retraining the model on new data or tweaking it to adapt to
            changes in the underlying data patterns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Together, these steps form a robust framework for developing and
            deploying machine learning models that are scalable, efficient, and
            effective. The thoughtful execution of each step ensures that the
            model remains relevant and valuable over time.
