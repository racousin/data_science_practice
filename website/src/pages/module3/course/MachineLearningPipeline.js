      <h1 className="my-4">Overview of the Machine Learning Pipeline</h1>
      <p>
        Understanding the machine learning pipeline is crucial for effectively
        applying models to real-world problems. This pipeline encompasses
        several key stages, each critical for ensuring the accuracy and
        efficiency of the final model.
      </p>
      {/* <Row>
        <Col md={12}>
          <h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
          <p>
            Data collection is the first step in the machine learning pipeline.
            It involves gathering the necessary data from various sources, which
            could include databases, online repositories, or real-time systems.
            The quality and quantity of data collected significantly impact the
            performance of the resulting model.
          </p>

          <h3 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning and Preparation</h3>
          <p>
            Once data is collected, it must be cleaned and prepared. This step
            involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting
            data into a format suitable for analysis. Effective data cleaning
            can significantly improve model accuracy.
          </p>

          <h3 id="feature-engineering">Feature Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to
            select, modify, or create new features from raw data. This step is
            vital as it directly influences the model's ability to learn
            significant patterns from the data.
          </p>

          <h3 id="model-building">Model Building</h3>
          <p>
            This stage involves selecting and training machine learning models
            using the prepared data. It may include experimenting with different
            model architectures, algorithms, and parameters to find the best fit
            for the data.
          </p>

          <h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3>
          <p>
            After a model is built, it must be evaluated to assess its
            performance. This usually involves using a separate validation
            dataset to test the model, ensuring that it generalizes well to new,
            unseen data.
          </p>

          <h3 id="deployment">Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            Deployment is the process of integrating a machine learning model
            into an existing production environment where it can make
            predictions on new data. This step requires careful planning to
            manage resources and ensure that the model performs as expected in
            real-time.
          </p>

          <h3 id="monitoring">Monitoring and Maintenance</h3>
          <p>
            Once deployed, it's essential to continuously monitor the model to
            catch any performance degradation or failures. Maintenance may
            involve retraining the model on new data or tweaking it to adapt to
            changes in the underlying data patterns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Together, these steps form a robust framework for developing and
            deploying machine learning models that are scalable, efficient, and
            effective. The thoughtful execution of each step ensures that the
            model remains relevant and valuable over time.

// Integrating EDA Throughout the Machine Learning Pipeline
// 1. Data Collection
// Initial Data Exploration: Even before deep data collection, preliminary EDA can help define what data is needed. Visualizations and basic statistics can guide the identification of key variables that are likely to impact the outcome.
// 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
// Detailed Examination of Data: Use EDA to understand the range, central tendencies, and dispersion of data. This step helps in identifying anomalies, outliers, and patterns in missing data.
// Data Quality Checks: EDA tools such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots can be used to visually check for data quality issues like outliers and anomalies.
// 3. Feature Engineering
// Feature Exploration: EDA is crucial here to discover potential relationships between variables that can be exploited to create new features. For example, combining variables, creating interaction terms, or decomposing complex variables (like dates) into simpler ones.
// Assessing Feature Impact: Visualize how different features affect the target variable, using plots like bar charts for categorical data or scatter plots for continuous data. This helps in understanding which features are most predictive.
// 4. Scaling and Normalization
// Distribution Checks: Post-feature engineering, use EDA to check the distributions of your newly created features. This informs decisions on the need for further normalization or scaling.
// 5. Model Building
// Correlation Analysis: Before diving into complex model building, EDA can be used to assess the correlation between features using heatmaps, which helps in understanding potential multicollinearity and the impact of different features on the model.
// 6. Model Evaluation
// Residual Analysis: EDA techniques can be applied post-model training to examine the residuals of your models. Plotting residuals against fitted values helps in diagnosing issues with model fit and indicating whether further adjustments or transformations are needed.
// 7. Deployment
// Validation: Use EDA to validate model outputs in production versus expected outcomes or versus a hold-out sample from your dataset. This can be achieved by visualizing the differences and similarities in distributions and key statistics.
// 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
// Trend Analysis: Regularly applying EDA to the output of your model can help catch shifts in data over time (data drift) or changes in model performance, prompting necessary recalibrations.
// 9. Documentation and Reporting
// Visual Reporting: EDA provides a graphical way to report on the findings from the model, the insights from the data, and any potential issues. Effective visualizations make the results accessible not just to data scientists but also to business stakeholders.
