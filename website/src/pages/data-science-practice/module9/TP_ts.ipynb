    "### The Rössler System\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Rössler system** is a set of three coupled ordinary differential equations that describe a chaotic dynamical system. Introduced by Otto Rössler in 1976, it is widely studied as a simple model of chaos. The equations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\frac{dx}{dt} &= -y - z, \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{dy}{dt} &= x + ay, \\\\\n",
    "    \\frac{dz}{dt} &= b + z(x - c),\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( x, y, z \\) are the system's state variables,\n",
    "- \\( a, b, c \\) are parameters that control the system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties of the Rössler System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chaotic System**:\n",
    "   - For certain parameter values, the system exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by sensitivity to initial conditions and the presence of a strange attractor.\n",
    "   - Common parameter values for chaos are \\( a = 0.2, b = 0.2, c = 5.7 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lyapunov Exponent**:\n",
    "   - The largest **Lyapunov exponent** quantifies the rate at which nearby trajectories diverge, a hallmark of chaos. A positive Lyapunov exponent indicates chaos. ($\\lambda_1$ =0.0714)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dissipative System**:\n",
    "   - A system is **dissipative** if the volume of its state space contracts over time. For the Rössler system, this can be shown by computing the divergence of the vector field:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f_z}{\\partial z} = -a.\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Since \\( a > 0 \\), the system is dissipative, leading to the formation of an attractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Applications**:\n",
    "   - The Rössler system is used in modeling chaotic circuits, understanding turbulence, and exploring the fundamental properties of chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an initial condition \\( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \\), the Rössler system can be integrated numerically to generate time series data. The output provides insight into the system's dynamics and serves as a benchmark for analyzing chaotic time series.\n"
