            Metrics for Evaluating Generative Models: Inception Score, FID
          </h2>
          <p>
            Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) are two popular
            metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated samples from a
            generative model. In this section, you will learn about these
            metrics and how to use them.

            Techniques to Enhance Diversity and Quality of Generated Samples
          </h2>
          <p>
            There are several techniques that can be used to enhance the
            diversity and quality of the generated samples from a generative
            model. In this section, you will learn about some of these
            techniques, including mode regularization and data augmentation.

          <h2>Overcoming Mode Collapse in GANs</h2>
          <p>
            Mode collapse is a common problem in GANs, where the generator
            generates a limited set of samples and fails to capture the full
            diversity of the data. In this section, you will learn about some
            strategies to overcome mode collapse, including minibatch
            discrimination and gradient penalty.
