          <h2>Integrating Docker into Development Workflows</h2>
          <p>
            Docker can be integrated into development workflows to ensure that
            the development environment is consistent with the production
            environment. This can be done by using Docker Compose to define the
            development environment and using Docker to build and test the
            application.
          </p>
          <h2>Deploying Containers in Production Environments</h2>
          <p>
            Docker can be used to deploy containers in production environments.
            This can be done by using a container orchestration platform such as
            Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage the deployment and scaling of
            containers.
          </p>
          <h2>Best Practices for Security with Docker</h2>
          <p>
            Docker provides several security features to ensure that containers
            are secure. These include using non-root users, limiting container
            privileges, and using secure container images.
