        In this section, you will dive into the integration of deep learning
        with reinforcement learning.

          <h2>Deep Q-Networks (DQN)</h2>
          <p>
            Here, we'll discuss what Deep Q-Networks are and how they combine
            deep learning and reinforcement learning.
          </p>

          <h2>Improvements on DQN</h2>
          <p>
            We'll cover some of the improvements that have been made on the
            original DQN algorithm.

          <p>
            We'll explore the DDPG algorithm, which is an extension of DQN to
            continuous action spaces.

          <h2>Applications in Games, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems</h2>
          <p>
            We'll discuss some of the applications of deep reinforcement
            learning in games, robotics, and autonomous systems.
