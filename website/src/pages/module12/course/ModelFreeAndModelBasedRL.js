        In this section, you will distinguish between model-free and model-based
        reinforcement learning.

          <h2>Model-Free RL</h2>
          <p>
            Here, we'll discuss what model-free reinforcement learning is and
            how it involves learning directly from interaction with the
            environment.
          </p>

          <h2>Model-Based RL</h2>
          <p>
            We'll cover the concept of model-based reinforcement learning, which
            involves using models of the environment for planning.
          </p>

          <h2>Trade-Offs and Applications</h2>
          <p>
            We'll explore the trade-offs between model-free and model-based
            methods and discuss some common applications of each approach.
