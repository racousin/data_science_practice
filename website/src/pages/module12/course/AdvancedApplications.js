          <h2>Machine Translation and Multilingual Processing</h2>
          <p>
            Machine translation involves translating text from one language to
            another. Multilingual processing involves handling text in multiple
            languages.

          <h2>Question Answering Systems</h2>
          <p>
            Question answering systems involve extracting answers to questions
            from a given text.

          <h2>Chatbots and Conversational AI</h2>
          <p>
            Chatbots and conversational AI involve building systems that can
            understand and generate human-like conversations.
