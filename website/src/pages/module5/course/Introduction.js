            In the realm of data science, the quality of data underpins the
            success of any analysis or predictive model. This course module is
            designed to equip you with advanced skills in data cleaning and
            preparation, ensuring you can enhance data accuracy and utility
            across diverse contexts. We will delve into systematic approaches to
            identify and correct inaccuracies, handle missing values, and
            transform data into formats suitable for analysis.

            Data cleaning involves more than just removing errors or duplicates;
            it's about understanding the nuances of data types, detecting
            underlying patterns, and making informed decisions about how to
            handle anomalies. By mastering these techniques, you will be able
            to:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Effectively manage missing data and understand the implications of
              different imputation techniques.
            </li>
            <li>
              Decode and transform categorical data, adapting it for analytical
              models that require numerical input.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify and resolve inconsistencies in data collection and entry
              that could skew analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilize feature engineering to uncover additional value from
              existing data sets.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify models
              without sacrificing the integrity of the data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each topic is curated to provide comprehensive insights into the
            practical challenges you'll face in real-world data science
            projects. From theoretical underpinnings to hands-on applications,
            this module will advance your abilities to prepare data rigorously,
            enhancing your overall analytical and predictive capabilities.
