          <h2>Definition and Significance of Generative Models</h2>
          <p>
            Generative models are a class of statistical models that can
            generate new data instances that resemble the training data. They
            have gained significant attention in recent years due to their
            ability to create realistic and diverse data samples, which can be
            used in a variety of applications such as image and video
            generation, text synthesis, and data augmentation.

          <h2>Overview of the Types of Generative Models</h2>
          <p>
            There are several types of generative models, each with its own
            strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular ones include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</strong>: VAEs are a type
              of neural network that can learn to compress and reconstruct data.
              They can also be used to generate new data instances by sampling
              from the learned latent space.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong>: GANs are
              a type of neural network that consists of two parts: a generator
              and a discriminator. The generator is trained to generate new data
              instances that resemble the training data, while the discriminator
              is trained to distinguish between real and fake data. The two
              parts are trained together in a minimax game, where the generator
              tries to fool the discriminator and the discriminator tries to
              correctly classify the data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Autoregressive Models</strong>: Autoregressive models are
              a type of statistical model that can generate new data instances
              by modeling the joint probability distribution of the data. They
              are often used in text synthesis and image generation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Energy-Based Models</strong>: Energy-based models are a
              type of statistical model that can generate new data instances by
              modeling the energy function of the data. They are often used in
              unsupervised learning and density estimation.

          <h2>Use Cases of Generative Models</h2>
          <p>
            Generative models have a wide range of applications in AI,
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Image and Video Generation</strong>: Generative models can
              be used to create realistic and diverse images and videos, which
              can be used in entertainment, advertising, and virtual reality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Text Synthesis</strong>: Generative models can be used to
              generate coherent and meaningful text, which can be used in
              chatbots, language translation, and content creation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Augmentation</strong>: Generative models can be used
              to create synthetic data that can be used to augment the training
              data, which can improve the performance of machine learning
              models.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Density Estimation</strong>: Generative models can be used
              to estimate the probability density function of the data, which
              can be used in anomaly detection, clustering, and dimensionality
              reduction.
