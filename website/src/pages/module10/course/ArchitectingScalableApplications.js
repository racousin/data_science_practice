          <h2>Architecting Multi-Tier Applications using GCP Services</h2>
          <p>
            Multi-tier applications can be architected using GCP services such
            as Compute Engine, App Engine, and Cloud Functions to provide
            scalability, reliability, and security.

          <h2>Disaster Recovery and High Availability Strategies</h2>
          <p>
            Disaster recovery and high availability strategies can be
            implemented using GCP services such as Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and
            Cloud Spanner to ensure that applications are available and
            resilient in the event of failures.
          </p>
          <h2>Performance Tuning and Cost Optimization Techniques</h2>
          <p>
            Performance tuning and cost optimization techniques can be used to
            optimize the performance and cost of applications on GCP. This can
            involve techniques such as caching, load balancing, and
            auto-scaling.
