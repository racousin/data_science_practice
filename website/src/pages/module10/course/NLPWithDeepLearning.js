          <h2>Sequence Models: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs</h2>
          <p>
            Sequence models, such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, are used to model
            sequential data, such as text.
          </p>
          <h3>RNNs</h3>
          <p>
            RNNs are a type of neural network that can process sequential data,
            maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous
            time steps.
          </p>

            code={`# Example of an RNN using TensorFlow
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim, output_dim),
    tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN(units),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])`}
          />
          <h3>LSTMs</h3>
          <p>
            LSTMs are a type of RNN that can capture long-term dependencies in
            sequential data, using a gating mechanism to control the flow of
            information.

])`}
          />
          <h3>GRUs</h3>
          <p>
            GRUs are a type of RNN that combine the advantages of LSTMs and
            RNNs, using a simpler gating mechanism to control the flow of
            information.

          <h2>Transformers and the Attention Mechanism</h2>
          <p>
            Transformers are a type of neural network that use the attention
            mechanism to capture dependencies between words in a sentence,
            without the need for recurrence or convolution.

            Implementing NLP Tasks with Libraries like Hugging Face Transformers
          </h2>
          <p>
            Libraries like Hugging Face Transformers provide pre-trained models
            and tools for implementing NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis,
            question answering, and translation.
