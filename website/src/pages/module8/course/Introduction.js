      <h2 id="history">Brief History of Computer Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Computer vision has its roots in the 1960s when researchers began
        exploring ways to mimic human visual perception using computers. Key
        milestones include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1960s: Early experiments with pattern recognition and edge detection
        </li>
        <li>
          1970s: Development of image segmentation techniques and optical flow
          algorithms
        </li>
        <li>
          1980s: Introduction of feature-based approaches and 3D computer vision
        </li>
        <li>1990s: Advances in face recognition and object detection</li>
        <li>
          2000s: Rise of machine learning approaches, particularly Support
          Vector Machines
        </li>

      <h2 id="challenges">Challenges in Computer Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Despite significant progress, computer vision still faces several
        challenges:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Variability in appearance: Objects can look different due to lighting,
          pose, or occlusion
        </li>
        <li>
          Scale and perspective: Objects can appear at different sizes and
          angles
        </li>
        <li>
          Background clutter: Distinguishing objects from complex backgrounds
        </li>
        <li>
          Computational efficiency: Balancing accuracy with speed for real-time
          applications
        </li>
        <li>
          Domain adaptation: Generalizing models to work in new environments
        </li>
        <li>Few-shot learning: Recognizing objects from limited examples</li>
        <li>Interpretability: Understanding and explaining model decisions</li>
        <li>
          Ethical concerns: Privacy issues and potential misuse of technology
        </li>
      </ul>
