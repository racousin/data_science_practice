          <h2>Introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</h2>
          <p>
            GANs are a type of generative model that consist of two components:
            a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates fake data,
            while the discriminator tries to distinguish between the fake data
            and real data. GANs can be used to generate realistic images, text,
            and music.

          <h2>Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models</h2>
          <p>
            Transfer learning is a technique that involves using a pre-trained
            model as a starting point for a new task. Fine-tuning involves
            training the pre-trained model on a new dataset, while keeping some
            of the weights fixed. Transfer learning can save time and improve
            performance on new tasks.

            Practical Applications and Current Research Trends in Deep Learning
          </h2>
          <p>
            Deep learning has been applied to a wide range of practical
            applications, including image classification, speech recognition,
            and autonomous driving. Current research trends in deep learning
            include developing more efficient architectures, improving model
            interpretability, and exploring new applications.
