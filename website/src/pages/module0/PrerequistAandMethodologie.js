          <h2>Methodology and Submitting Exercises</h2>
          <p>
            Each module in this course consists of lectures and hands-on
            exercises. Hereâ€™s how you will interact with the course content and
            submit your exercises:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Module Structure:</strong> Each module will have a
              theoretical component accessible via GitHub and practical
              exercises that you need to complete.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Submitting Exercises:</strong> For each exercise, you will
              create a new branch in the repository, add your solutions to your
              username folder under the respective module (e.g.,
              usernameFolder/module1/yourfiles), and submit a pull request.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Review Process:</strong> Your submission will be reviewed
              by a collaborator (course administrator) who will provide feedback
              or approve the merge into the main branch. This process ensures
              that your work meets the required standards and does not interfere
              with the core repository structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CI/CD Validation:</strong> Upon merging, CI/CD processes
              will run tests to validate your exercises. Successful completion
              will update your status on the course's official student results
              page.
            </li>
          </ul>
